      <h2>üññ Hey friends,</h2>
      <p>
        To all 22 of you, thank you for permitting me to park this email right here in your inbox. If you can find the time to read it and vote (see below) I would greatly appreciate it and if you have any thoughts (including compliments on epic text-symbol wave) or questions please chuck a reply.
      </p>
      <h3>What is this CoastalCoder nonsense?</h3>
      <p>
        So, in amongst work life, playing World of Warcraft and surfing, I have decided to start writing down and sending out casual documentaries of tech development projects. With the goal of making them understandable for readers of all backgrounds. Maybe some professional stuff but probably side-project stuff most of the time. You can anticipate one coming out every couple of weeks or so. It won‚Äôt be too often but hopefully vaguely regular.
      </p>
      <p>
        The motivation behind them is pretty much just to have a creative outlet and a reason to pursue interesting ideas. But if any kind of audience ends up appearing it would be awesome if these documentaries could help them learn or inspire them. Maybe one day there will be a cool little community of people in the email list and we could start doing challenges together ‚Äòn‚Äô stuff. Maybe you guys will simply enjoy just following along, that would be dope too. Might as well try it, ay?
      </p>
      <p>
         For those interested in tech but not interested in deep webdev jargon, I promise to try to keep these documentaries brief and refrain from getting too dry and technical. It's easy for web-nerds to spout endless fountains of unhelpful minutia that only interests themselves. This won't be that. If you ever think I'm doing that, I give you permission to egg me.
      </p>
      <h2>üç¨ But wait, there's a twist!</h2>
      <p>
        As 2019 has proven how wildly successful democracy is I thought I'd follow suit and give power to the people! In each email there will be a link to a poll so you guys can choose the project for the next documentary. Let's see how long this lasts before it ends in tears...
      </p>
      <p>
        Without further ado, <strong>here are the options for project 1</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Easy networking in a real-time, group meditation webapp (Websockets, App-design)</p></li>
        <li><p>Creating a beginner-friendly (partially-)static React framework (SEO, ReactJS)</p></li>
        <li><p>Machine-learning in a guitar effect-pedal guesser app (BrainJS, Server-side Audio Analysis)</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        <strong>Share link: </strong>If you have a geeky friend that might enjoy reading this then just link them to <a href='https://coastalcoder.co'>https://coastalcoder.co</a> or forward this email over to them.

      <p>
        If you are reading this because a friend gave you the link or forwarded it to you, I'd love it if you allowed me to park my emails in your inbox too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks. See you next time with the project of your choice üíú
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh and if you don't want to see this ever again just reply with 'unsubscribe' and I'll remove you from the list, no hard feelings. I will also make proper subscribe and unsubscribe links at some point... Google forms is a bit of a hack for now.
