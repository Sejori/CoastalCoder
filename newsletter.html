      <h2>🖖 Welcome all,</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re reading this then thank you for permitting me to park this email right here in your inbox. If you can find the time to read it I would greatly appreciate that (read till end for dramatic twist) and if you have any feedback (including compliments on epic text-symbol wave) or questions please chuck me a reply!
      </p>
      <p>
        So, in amongst work life, playing World of Warcraft and surfing, I have decided to start writing down and sending out casual documentaries of tech development projects. With the goal of making them understandable for readers of all backgrounds. Some professional stuff but probably side-project stuff most of the time. You can anticipate one coming out every couple of weeks or so, it won’t be too often but hopefully vaguely regular.
      </p>
      <p>
        The motivation behind them is pretty much just to have a creative outlet and a reason to pursue interesting ideas. But if any kind of audience ends up appearing it would be awesome if these documentaries could help them learn or inspire them. Maybe one day there will be a cool little community of people in the email list and we could start doing challenges together ‘n’ stuff. Maybe you guys will simply enjoy just following along, that would be dope too. Might as well try it, ay?
      </p>
      <p>
         For those interested in tech but not interested in deep webdev jargon, I promise to try to keep these documentaries brief and refrain from getting too dry and technical. It's easy for web-nerds to spout endless fountains of unhelpful minutia that only interests themselves. This won't be that. If you ever think I'm doing that, I give you permission to egg me.
      </p>
      <h2>🍬 But wait there's a twist!</h2>
      <p>
        As 2019 has proven how wildly successful democracy is I thought I'd follow suit and give power to the people! In each email there will be a link to a poll so you, the reader, can choose the project for the next documentary. Let's see how long this lasts before it ends in tears... too soon?
      </p>
      <p>
        Without further ado, <u>here are the options for project 1</u>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Easy networking in a real-time, group meditation webapp (Websockets, App-design)</p></li>
        <li><p>Creating a beginner-friendly (partially-)static React framework (SEO, ReactJS)</p></li>
        <li><p>Machine-learning in a guitar effect-pedal guesser app (BrainJS, Server-side Audio Analysis)</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Go ahead and cast your vote here: <a href="https://forms.gle/A1giLgn74Ndt2WxA9">https://forms.gle/A1giLgn74Ndt2WxA9</a>!

      <h2>👼 Day 0 Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        On a final note, I have a Day 0 challenge for you 20 blessed people. It'll take 1 minute and I'll love you forever I promise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay here we go: Sit back... take a breath... clear your mind.... Now think of your first friend that comes to mind when you read this one word: hacker-nerd-that-might-enjoy-reading-this-too.
      </p>
      <p>
         Now keep that name in your mind (if it's me that's lovely but not helpful so think of a different one) and ask yourself, do you know that persons email address? If so, forward away! If not, just send them the link: <a href="https://coastalcoder.co">https://coastalcoder.co</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         If you are reading this because a friend forwarded it to you, I'd love it if you voted and allowed me to park my emails in your inbox too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks. See you next time 💜
